# TextTkAPI

REST API for Speedy Text Pre-Processing

## About

TextTkAPI is a RESTful API built to allow users to complete simple text cleaning and pre-processing for natural language processing & machine learning. It is built using Flask and the nltk library to perform tasks such as tokenization, lemmitization, stemming, contraction removal, and n-gram clustering.

While the nltk library is highly advanced, much of the necessary code to pre-process text is highly repetitive and boilerplate. This API allows users to create an HTTP based ETL pipeline to complete the preprocessing in much fewer lines of code, speeding up the process and getting the user to the NLP task at hand much sooner.
